ðŸ”— [LCPP APOC Map](https://github.com/nzkfc/lcpp_apoc_map)  

## Dependencies  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- [Interact Sound](https://github.com/plunkettscott/interact-sound)  
- [PolyZone](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone)

## Installation  
1. Place the `lcpp_apoc_infection_zones` folder inside your server's `resources` directory.  
2. Copy and paste the `interact-sound` folder over your existing one to add the necessary sounds (it follows the same folder structure).  
3. Add resource to `server.cfg` (only required if sitting in it's own folder, if it's nested e.g. [standalone] then you can skip this)
4. Start your server.  

## Configuration  
The default configuration is set for use with the **LCPP APOC Map**. If needed, you can modify the settings in the config file to suit your requirements.
